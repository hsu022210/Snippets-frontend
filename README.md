## Development

This project uses TypeScript with strict type checking and ESLint for code quality. The development environment is set up with Vite for fast development and hot module replacement (HMR).

For production builds, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. The project is already configured with TypeScript and `typescript-eslint` for optimal development experience.
